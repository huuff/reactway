# Tasks
* Try to make it so dragging does not toggle
* Choosing size of the cells
* Hiding settings in a drawer
* `MapGrid` and `ArrayGrid` tests are pretty much the same... can't I do some sort of property testing so I can pass the same parameters and just change the implementation?
* A dark mode so it's not so harsh on my eyes?
* Only showing the move cursor when the grid is larger than the screen?
* What about rendering only the part of the grid that's visible? That might be helpful with performance, though hard.
* Optimize `MapGrid` as I did for `SetGrid`
