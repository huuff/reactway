# Tasks
* Make a page showing some guns like Gosper's Glider Gun
* Rendering only the visible parts:
  * Do it for `TableGrid` too
  * Do it for `AsciiGrid` too
* `MapGrid` and `ArrayGrid` tests are pretty much the same... can't I do some sort of property testing so I can pass the same parameters and just change the implementation?
