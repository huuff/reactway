# Tasks
* Action factories for my dispatches?
* Try to make it so dragging does not toggle
* Choosing size of the cells
* Hiding settings in a drawer
* `MapGrid` and `ArrayGrid` tests are pretty much the same... can't I do some sort of property testing so I can pass the same parameters and just change the implementation?
* A dark mode so it's not so harsh on my eyes?
* Only showing the move cursor when the grid is larger than the screen?
* Snapshot test the grids?
* What about rendering only the part of the grid that's visible? That might be helpful with performance, though hard.
* There's some hydration error with fontawesome because titles are generated randomly and thus they differ from the server and the client.
