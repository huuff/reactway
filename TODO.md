# Tasks
* Action factories for my dispatches?
* Try to make it so dragging does not toggle
* Choosing size of the cells
* Hiding settings in a drawer
* Try to use the React Hooks Testing Library instead of creating a component only to test a Hook (I think I did this for settings?)
* `MapGrid` and `ArrayGrid` tests are pretty much the same... can't I do some sort of property testing so I can pass the same parameters and just change the implementation?
* A dark mode so it's not so harsh on my eyes?
* Only showing the move cursor when the grid is larger than the screen?
* Snapshot test the grids?
